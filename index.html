<p>
One of the first things you need to do before becoming a designer is knowing how to accurately draw 3D images, for example, this photo:
</p>

<p>
This is an example of a 3D design sketch of a bedroom. Before starting to build and design you need a clear image of how you will layout and set up your room. If you don't make a drawing/sketch, there is no proof that you know what you are doing, this is also necessary due to the fact that you might mess up and won't have even a simple idea of your creative thoughts.

How do I start a career in Interior Design?
</h2>
</div>
<p>
It's really quite simple but first of all you need to success in <strong>ART</strong> 
Why? because interior design includes the topic of it. You need a creative mind in order to gain attention from your amazing ideas.Obviously you can't just go straight in and say oh! I want to stufy art and be a designer because that isn't how it works. You MUST success in it in school before this. (this is an obvious and clear point). Basically like most other subjects and jobs.

<br>

As you can see I've added a video on how to become an interior designer. But you should definitely know that you aren't going to become one in just a day or week. It will take months and months before it has become a full career and job.
